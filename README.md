## 💡 Inspiration

The idea behind **Greeden** was to design a calming, green-inspired landing page that promotes eco-consciousness, gardening, and nature. I wanted to see how far Tailwind CSS alone can take a design without relying on external stylesheets or heavy frameworks.

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas I might work on:

* Add contact and product detail pages
* Integrate a basic shopping cart
* Improve accessibility and animations
* Add dark mode toggle
